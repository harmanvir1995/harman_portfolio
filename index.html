            <p>
              I am a results-driven DevOps Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in
              Computer Science from Concordia University, Montreal. As a former
              member of the Space Concordia organization, I gained experience
              working collaboratively on complex projects with a team of
              engineers. During my time as a DevOps intern, I honed my skills in
              automation, continuous integration and delivery, and cloud
              infrastructure management. I also gained experience working with
              tools such as Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and
              Azure. <br />In addition to my technical skills, I am committed to
              giving back to my community. I have volunteered my time at
              Gurudwara Nanak Darbar, where I assisted with social work
              initiatives. I also worked as a technician in the AITS department
              at Concordia University, where I helped solve various tickets
              related to networking and other computer-related problems.
              <br />Overall, I am a dedicated and hardworking individual who is
              passionate about DevOps and always eager to learn more. I thrive
              in fast-paced environments and am always looking for new
              challenges to tackle.
