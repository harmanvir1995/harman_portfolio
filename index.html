                    <p>I am a results-driven DevOps Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Concordia University, Montreal. As a former member of the Space Concordia organization, I gained experience working collaboratively on complex projects with a team of engineers.
                        During my time as a DevOps intern, I honed my skills in automation, continuous integration and delivery, and cloud infrastructure management. I also gained experience working with tools such as Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and Azure.
                       <br>In addition to my technical skills, I am committed to giving back to my community. I have volunteered my time at Gurudwara Nanak Darbar, where I assisted with social work initiatives. I also worked as a technician in the AITS department at Concordia University, where I helped solve various tickets related to networking and other computer-related problems.
                        <br>Overall, I am a dedicated and hardworking individual who is passionate about DevOps and always eager to learn more. I thrive in fast-paced environments and am always looking for new challenges to tackle.</p>
